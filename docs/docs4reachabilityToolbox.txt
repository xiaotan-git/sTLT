Instructions:
1. First go over [1] and [2] to understand why Reachability problem can be casted as an optimal control problem, and how to write out the corresponding Hamilton-Jacob equation.
2. Then check [3] and the tutorial in their repo to understand what the parameters/flags mean in th HJB equation.
3. If you need to solve some PDE that is more complex than what this helperOC provides, check [4] for solutions.
